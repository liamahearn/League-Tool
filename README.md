# RiftPal

This is a work-in-progress website that provides League of Legends players with valuable matchup information based on their own individual playing. 

## Tech Stack

I am using a lot of stuff here- TypeScript, React, Node.js, Tailwind, SQLite, and more- most of which I haven't really touched before or used in a project by myself. This means that this project may feel messy to develop, but I'm committed to learning and making it the best it can be! 

A lot of the current project structure is based around learning the respective technologies, but I'm trying to build up functionality as I go. I'm using ChatGPT to help out with implementing a lot of the big unknowns for me, which is very helpful at explaining the granular details! 

By inputting a player's in-game name and tag (number), the Riot API is called, retrieving certain player-specific information. This info is then inserted into a database, and the player's profile picture is displayed.
